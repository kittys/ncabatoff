// vlib is a refactored version of github.com/BurntSushi/imgv intended as a
// developer tool.  The idea is that it's a tool for navigating a list of
// images, some or all of which might never actually exist in the filesystem.
// I use this approach for playing with image processing code where I want to
// be able to experiment easily with different parameters and quickly visualize
// the result.
package vlib
